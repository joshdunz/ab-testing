            <h2>1. About </h2>
            <h4>The task of the project was to conduct A/B Test on a given webpage and another webpage with suggested improvements :</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I sought to prove that my editted page with higher contrast increased accuracy and cut down time spent on the booking site</li>
                    <li>The testing helped me determine whether the adjustment of my target levers were effective at improving the user experience</li>
                    <li>Broadly the levers I chose were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using primary colors</li>
                            <li>Using Higher contrast font colours</li>
                            <li>Using font weights to demarcate categories of information</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The website has a low contrast color scheme making text hard to read</li>
                        <li>The buttons on the right: "See Appointment" and "Schedule Appointment" are not distinguisable </li>
                        <li>The date section and details section are not clearly demarcated</li>

                        <li>The date section color was changed to blue to show clear separation from details </li>
                        <li>The Details section font color was changed to black from grey for greater contrast</li>
