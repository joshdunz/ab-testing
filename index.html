            <h2>1. About </h2>
            <h3>The task of the project was to conduct A/B Test on a given webpage (Version A) and another webpage with suggested improvements (Version B).</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I sought to prove that my editted page with higher contrast increased accuracy and cut down time spent on the booking site</li>
                    <li>The testing helped me determine whether the adjustment of my target levers were effective at improving the user experience</li>
                    <li>Broadly the levers I chose were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using primary colors</li>
                            <li>Using Higher contrast font colours</li>
                            <li>Using font weights to demarcate categories of information</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>I used 3 metrics that were measured in the backend when the test subjects interacted with the webpage:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time to first click(milliseconds)</li>
                        <li>Time spent on Page (milliseconds)</li>
                        <li>Whether a misclick occured (True/False)</li>
                    <ul>
        
            <h2>2. Initial website problems (Version A)</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The website has a low contrast color scheme making text hard to read</li>
                        <li>The buttons on the right: "See Appointment" and "Schedule Appointment" are not distinguisable </li>
                        <li>The date section and details section are not clearly demarcated</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Dark blue was used to demarcate the buttons using contrast</li>
                        <li>The date section color was changed to blue to show clear separation from details </li>
                        <li>The Details section font color was changed to black from grey for greater contrast</li>

        <h2>5. Summary Original VS Updated Site </h2>
        <h3>It is likely that the updated site is better than the original</h3>
        <h4>We see that on average the time on page spent is less in version B(Updated site - 8173 ms) than in version A(Original site-29411ms). </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Version B also has a significantly larger variance (5974262) which is a measure of the spread of data values from the mean as compared to the original site (341951899). This signals that the average value of the time on page for the update site is more representative of the data than in the original site meaning that users are more likely to have more consistently shorter web experiences on the updated page </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>We see that on average the time to first click is less in version B(Updated site - 5234ms) than in version A(Original site-10452ms). </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Version B also has a significantly larger variance (6379378) than the original site (27388063). This signals that the individual results of the time till first click were closer to the average value for the updated site than in the original site meaning that users are more likely to make decisions more quickly and act on them on the updated page than the original </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>We see that expected value of the rate of misclicks is lower in the original (4.5) than the updated(11.5) </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> That means that the misclicks occur far more frequently in the original than the updated and users are able to be more accurate with their actions in the later </li>
        </ul>
